Question 1: When will you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: when the remote repository contains information totally independent of my project.

Question 2:	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository

Answer:	so that Git doesn't pull changes when you are working on a file. it is better to commit your changes before making a pull request.

Question 3:	Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other

Answer:	so that you can work with the latest update to the project without internet connection.

Question 5:	How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
